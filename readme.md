# Frequency Counter

This Go program takes a string input and generates a map showing the frequency of each character in the string.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Go installed on your system.
2. Run the program using `go run . <string>`, where `<string>` is the input string for which you want to calculate character frequencies.

Example:
```bash
go run . "hello world"
```

## Output

The program will output a map where keys represent each unique character in the input string, and values represent the frequency of each character.

Example output:
```
map[e:1 d:1 h:1 l:3 o:2 r:1 w:1 ]
```
